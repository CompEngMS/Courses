# Computer Engineering MS

This is a collection of useful material, notes, exercises, exams, homework and much more.

## General policy

Courses evolve over the years, professors change and/or update their material (hopefully quite) often.
If only little changes occur, we prefer updating the material of the repository of the corresponding course: e.g., we update the notes or the slides with new topics.

If a course is completely renewed, we prefer archiving the old repository (we will not delete it, by the way) and create a new one.
The same applies for old courses not taught anymore.

## How to contribute

### Add material

You can open a PR to the corresponding project.
We will merge it as soon as possible.

### Report missing our outdated material

Open a new issue and we will try to improve the repository.
As specified above, if the material is really really outdated, maybe because the course has been re-organized or a new professor teaches it, we would probably create a new repo for the course.
